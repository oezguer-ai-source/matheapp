# Phase 10: Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-04-15
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

A running Next.js application where children and teachers can log in with role-appropriate credentials, sessions persist, and the database schema enforces data isolation through RLS. Children use a simple username+PIN login (no email visible). Teachers use email+password. Role-based routing separates child and teacher dashboards.

## Implementation Decisions

### Child authentication method
- **D-01:** Children log in with **Benutzername (display name) + 4-digit PIN** — no email field shown
- **D-02:** Teachers create child accounts — no self-registration for children in MVP
- **D-03:** Behind the scenes, Supabase receives a generated email (`{username}.{class_id}@matheapp.internal`) + PIN as password via `signInWithPassword()`
- **D-04:** The login form for children shows only two fields: Benutzername and PIN (large, touch-friendly inputs)

### Teacher authentication
- **D-05:** Teachers log in with standard **email + password** using Supabase Auth
- **D-06:** Teacher registration is a simple sign-up form (email + password + name) — no admin approval needed for MVP

### Supabase auth strategy
- **D-07:** Use `@supabase/supabase-js` + `@supabase/ssr` for cookie-based sessions compatible with Next.js App Router
- **D-08:** No NextAuth.js, no OAuth providers — Supabase Auth handles everything directly
- **D-09:** Login page has a role-switch toggle (Kind / Lehrkraft) that shows the appropriate form fields

### Database schema
- **D-10:** Tables: `profiles` (user_id FK to auth.users, role, grade_level, display_name, class_id, optional pin_hint), `classes` (id, teacher_id, name, school_id), `schools` (id, name, subscription_tier), `progress_entries` (child_id, operation_type, grade, correct, points_earned, created_at)
- **D-10a:** PIN is NEVER stored as plain text. PIN lives exclusively as a bcrypt hash in `auth.users.encrypted_password` (managed by Supabase Auth). A nullable `pin_hint` column exists only for teacher-visible hints (optional, not the actual PIN). This refines D-10 based on RESEARCH A1 (security: prevent plaintext PIN storage).
- **D-11:** RLS policies: children can only read/write their own profile and progress data; teachers can read all profiles and progress in their class; no cross-class data access. Use `SECURITY DEFINER` helper functions in a private schema to avoid infinite recursion.
- **D-12:** `role` field in `profiles` determines routing and access — values: `child` | `teacher`. Role is also stored in `auth.users.app_metadata.role` (user cannot modify) as authoritative source; profiles.role is a mirror for JOIN queries.
- **D-13:** `schools` table includes `subscription_tier` field (default: `free`) for Phase 60 subscription gate — schema created now, logic implemented later
- **D-13a:** Teacher signup flow creates the teacher's school and first class atomically in the signup server action: form collects email + password + Name + Schulname + Klassenname. This resolves RESEARCH Q1 (no orphaned teachers without a class). Additional classes can be added later via teacher dashboard (Phase 50).

### Route structure and role-based routing
- **D-14:** Next.js App Router with route groups: `(child)` for child-facing pages, `(teacher)` for teacher dashboard
- **D-15:** Middleware checks auth session + role from `profiles` table and redirects unauthorized access
- **D-16:** Unauthenticated users → `/login`; children trying teacher routes → `/kind/dashboard`; teachers trying child routes → `/lehrer/dashboard`

### UI and styling foundation
- **D-17:** Tailwind CSS v4 for all styling — no additional component library for child-facing UI
- **D-18:** shadcn/ui initialized but only used in `(teacher)` route group
- **D-19:** Child login form: large text (`text-4xl`), rounded buttons (`rounded-2xl`), saturated colors, touch-friendly targets (min 48px)
- **D-20:** Teacher login form: standard professional form using shadcn/ui components
- **D-21:** German language throughout all UI text

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact color palette choices (within the constraint of bold, child-friendly colors)
- Login page layout and visual hierarchy
- Exact RLS policy SQL syntax
- Supabase project setup details
- Error message wording and validation UX
- Loading states and transition animations on login

</decisions>

## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable Assets
- None — greenfield project, no existing code

### Established Patterns
- None — this phase establishes the foundational patterns

### Integration Points
- Supabase project must be created and configured before development starts
- `create-next-app` scaffolds the project with TypeScript and Tailwind pre-configured

</code_context>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Child login should feel safe and simple — like entering a game, not like logging into a business app
- PIN should be numeric-only with large on-screen number buttons (preparation for Phase 30 exercise UI pattern)
- Role-switch on login page should be obvious but not confusing for children who arrive at the page

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
